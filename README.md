# Web3 Front-End DApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It relies on a local [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
blockchain to demonstrate basic [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.4/) library calls to a smart contract.
